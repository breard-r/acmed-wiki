A configuration file can include other files using the `include` directive. This directive is an array of strings representing the relative or absolute path to one or more file to include. If relative, it is relative to the configuration file which included it.

Unix style globing is supported.

``` toml
include = [
    "/etc/acmed/endpoints.toml",
    "certs-enabled/*.toml"
]
```

The above example includes one or more files. The `/etc/acmed/endpoints.toml` file is included first, then every file located in the `certs-enabled` sub-directory with a `.toml` extension.
